    <p>
        1. Prototype and complete original virtual/augmented reality applications for multiple platforms utilizing a full project 
        development lifecycle from concept to completion.
        <br>
        2. Create and implement immersive user experiences that utilize the interactive approaches unique to virtual/augmented 
        reality hardware and platforms.
        <br>
        3. Design and develop simulations that leverage gamification of virtual/augmented reality platforms to enhance the outcomes 
        of non-entertainment applications such as training, medical, therapeutic, military or learning-based environments.
        <br>
        4. Create the designs, assets, scripting and programming needed to effectively realize fully interactive and engaging virtual 
        reality worlds.
        <br>
        5. Create, implement, evaluate and analyze systems and mechanics that demonstrate visualizations of data relating to realworld entities, events and interactions using written and verbal communication skills.
        <br>
        6. Establish collaboration, mentorship and professional leadership skills by working with other disciplines to deliver highly 
        polished and completed projects in the virtual/augmented reality space.
